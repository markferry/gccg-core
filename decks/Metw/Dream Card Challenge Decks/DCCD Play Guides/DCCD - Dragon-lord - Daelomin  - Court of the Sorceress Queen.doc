\pard\b0\fs22\par
Daelomin has sited on the top of the Dancing Spire as she gathers her court of magicians to create her empire. Now She and her worshippers claim to build the greatest army of all times. Could She and her followers have the charm enough to rouse the northern clans so She can sit upon her hoard with a big crown on her head, and become the most terrorific Sorceress Queen of the Middle-Earth?\par

\fi-360\li720\ulnone\b0 You will, most likely, going to have 2 companies, one formed by the starting characters and the later one will be the wanderer Dragon-Lord. Both companies can try to get any resource from the deck, just remember to keep a \i War-Wolf\i0  in hand while moving to \i Tower of the Wolf Friend \i0 to get the ally point together with the \i Snow Trolls\i0  faction, the same can be done at \i Mount Gundabad\i0  or \i Sarn Goriwing\i0 .\par
\pard{\pntext\f0 2.\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlbody\pnf0\pnindent360\pnstart2\pndec{\pntxta.}}
\fi-360\li720 Beware that characters must be played with an influence attempt in the site phase at their home site and that you must tap a character to do so (your Dragonlord does not need to tap and may play them also during organization phase, so use him preferably). The non-unique Trolls may also be played at non-Dragon's Lair Ruins & Lairs and can subsequently play an item there. Next turn you can transfer the item to someone who is going to give it a better use.\par
\pard{\pntext\f0 3.\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlbody\pnf0\pnindent360\pnstart3\pndec{\pntxta.}}
\fi-360\li720 There isn\rquote t much sideboarding to do with the Dragon-Lord, analyze the situation and bring whatever is most useful. You might want to sideboard quickly a few cards: \i Dragon King\i0  and \i Tokens to Show \i0 or \i Voices of Malice \i0 in case of an overload of ahunts in you area.\i .\i0\par
\pard{\pntext\f0 4.\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlbody\pnf0\pnindent360\pnstart4\pndec{\pntxta.}}
\fi-360\li720 If you get an early item, Daelomin can try to get it, moving with \i Rumour of Treasure\i0 . After that you can go back to the Den and store the item for full MPs. Once you draw Dragon-flight, Daelomin is ready to enter action once again.\par
\pard{\pntext\f0 5.\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlbody\pnf0\pnindent360\pnstart5\pndec{\pntxta.}}
\fi-360\li720 After exhausting you might want to bring the \i Tribute Garnered \i0 into deck, there is a chance to draw it before calling for some extra points.\par
\pard{\pntext\f0 6.\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlbody\pnf0\pnindent360\pnstart6\pndec{\pntxta.}}
\fi-360\li720 Take advantage of the \i Thror\rquote s Map\i0  trick while going to any dragon\rquote s lair, and you will hopefully play 2 items in one turn.\par
\pard{\pntext\f0 7.\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlbody\pnf0\pnindent360\pnstart7\pndec{\pntxta.}}
\fi-360\li720 Give \i Wielder of Old Arts\i0  to the Disciple, then start recycling \i Artful Words\i0 , that way influencing the factions for the \i Great Army of the North\i0 , should be much easier.\par
\pard{\pntext\f0 8.\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlbody\pnf0\pnindent360\pnstart8\pndec{\pntxta.}}
\fi-360\li720 Final tips: \par
\pard{\pntext\f0 1\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlbody\pnf0\pnindent360\pnstart1\pndec }
\fi-360\li1440 Use \i Beaten into submission\i0  and \i Mating Duel \i0 with your own ahunts if your opponent isn\rquote t playing any Dragon on you. Beware not to move the main company on the ahunt area without any canceller. Once you get a \i Mating Duel, \i0 consider sideboarding in the \i Dragon\rquote s Nest\i0\par
\pard{\pntext\f0 2\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlbody\pnf0\pnindent360\pnstart2\pndec }
\fi-360\li1440 As most of the girls like jewels, Daelomin isn\rquote t the exception; she can be pumped up a bit by sacrificing \i Torque of Hues, Honey\i0  and/or \i Magical Harp \i0 for \i Scales and Jewels\i0 .\par
\pard{\pntext\f0 3\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlbody\pnf0\pnindent360\pnstart3\pndec }
\fi-360\li1440 Use \i Calm Song \i0 to go through hard automatic-attacks and \i Tormented Earth\i0 / \i Crept along Cleverly\i0  vs strong creatures. The starting \i Flaming Torch\i0  should help in case of facing awakened plants or any kind of animals, if none of that is useful, then the starting \i Foul-smelling Paste\i0  will do its job.\par
\pard{\pntext\f0 4\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlbody\pnf0\pnindent360\pnstart4\pndec }
\fi-360\li1440 If by the end of the game Daelomin wears \i Durin\rquote s Crown\i0  or \i The Iron Crown\i0 , use \i Token to Show \i0 on your \i Dragon King\i0\rquote s site to store them for full MPs. What is a Queen without a crown after all? \par
